# STRIVE
## Project Introduction
Digital Twin-based VEC is emerging as a promising solution. It monitors the state of the VEC network in real-time through mappings and interactions between physical and virtual entities. Consequently, the task offloading scheme makes more reasonable offloading decisions at the physical layer and further improves the efficiency of VEC. Therefore, we propose a VEC computing offloading scheme named Adaptive Swarm Intelligent Offloading Scheme Based On Digital Twin-Assisted prediction In VEC (STRIVE). A VEC network architecture is established that combines DT with an improved Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The powerful prediction ability of GAN is used to assist to construct DT in pre-processing phase, to reduce the size of decision space. To adapt to the dynamic nature of VEC, we establish an adaptive model to adjust the real-time parameter under various scenarios. Then, we deploy an improved genetic simulated annealing-based particle swarm optimization (IGSP) algorithm to task offloading decision-making, which can provide reliable computing services for vehicles at a low cost.
